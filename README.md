# Travelingo

A full-stack, data-driven travel recommendation system that helps users plan trips and discover destinations based on their preferences, time of year, and season.

## Project Goals
- Allow users to input travel preferences, dates, and possible destinations
- Recommend the best locations and generate personalized itineraries
- Use data science and machine learning for smart recommendations
- Provide a modern, user-friendly web interface

## Key Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Destination and activity database
- Intelligent recommendation engine (season-aware)
- Itinerary planner
- Responsive frontend UI
- Deployable with CI/CD and Docker

## Initial User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter my travel preferences and dates so I can get personalized recommendations.
- As a user, I want to see the best destinations for my chosen season.
- As a user, I want to view and edit my generated itinerary.
- As an admin, I want to manage destinations and activities in the system.

## Tech Stack (Proposed)
- Frontend: React (or Vue)
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- ML/Data Science: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)
- Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions, cloud provider (Azure/AWS/Heroku)

## Next Steps
- Gather detailed requirements and refine user stories
- Set up backend and frontend frameworks
- Design database schema
- Build MVP for user input and recommendations
